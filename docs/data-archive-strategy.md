# Healthcare AI Microservices - Data Archive Strategy

> **üìÖ Future Reference: Data Lifecycle Management**
>
> This document outlines the data archive strategy for the healthcare AI microservices platform.
> **Note**: This is for future implementation, not current development priority.

## üìã **Document Information**

- **Document Title**: Data Archive Strategy for Healthcare AI Microservices
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Author**: Healthcare AI Team
- **Status**: Future Reference
- **Priority**: Low (implement after core functionality is complete)

## üéØ **Overview**

### **What This Is**
This document defines the data archive strategy for managing data lifecycle, performance optimization, and healthcare compliance requirements over time.

### **Why This Matters**
- **Performance**: Keep active tables small and fast
- **Compliance**: Maintain healthcare data retention requirements (6-year HIPAA requirement)
- **Cost**: Optimize storage costs for different data tiers
- **Legal**: Support legal hold and discovery requirements

### **Scope**
- **In Scope**: Archive strategy, table structure, movement rules, query patterns
- **Out of Scope**: Implementation details, specific automation jobs, legal review processes

## üóÑÔ∏è **Archive Table Structure**

### **Current Active Tables (6)**
```
user_profiles
patient_profiles
provider_profiles
appointments
medical_records
audit_logs
```

> **üìã Current Schema**: See [Data Strategy](data-strategy.md) for complete current table structure and relationships.

### **Added Archive Tables (4)**
```
appointments_archive
medical_records_archive
audit_logs_archive
```

### **Added Deletion Tables (4)**
```
appointments_deleted
medical_records_deleted
audit_logs_deleted
```

## üìÖ **Archive Timeline Strategy**

### **Three-Tier Data Lifecycle**

#### **Tier 1: Active (0-2 years)**
- **Purpose**: Daily operations, frequent access
- **Tables**: Original tables (appointments, medical_records, etc.)
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes, fast queries
- **Access Pattern**: 99% of daily traffic

#### **Tier 2: Archive (2-7 years)**
- **Purpose**: Historical reference, compliance access
- **Tables**: *_archive tables
- **Performance**: Basic indexes, slower queries acceptable
- **Access Pattern**: 1% of traffic (historical queries)

#### **Tier 3: Legal Hold (7+ years)**
- **Purpose**: Legal compliance only, rare access
- **Tables**: *_deleted tables (marked for eventual deletion)
- **Performance**: Minimal indexes, very slow queries acceptable
- **Access Pattern**: Rare compliance queries

## üîÑ **Archive Movement Rules**

### **Which Tables Get Archived**

#### **High Volume Tables (Need Archiving)**
‚úÖ **appointments** ‚Üí appointments_archive ‚Üí appointments_deleted
‚úÖ **medical_records** ‚Üí medical_records_archive ‚Üí medical_records_deleted

‚úÖ **audit_logs** ‚Üí audit_logs_archive ‚Üí audit_logs_deleted

#### **Low Volume Tables (No Archiving)**
‚ùå **user_profiles** (never archive - always needed)
‚ùå **patient_profiles** (static reference data)
‚ùå **provider_profiles** (static reference data)
‚ùå **medical_record_extensions** (low volume, keep with medical_records)

### **Movement Triggers**
- **To Archive**: Automated monthly job (data older than 2 years)
- **To Deleted**: Automated annual job (data older than 7 years)
- **Actual Deletion**: Manual process after legal review (10+ years)

## üìä **Archive Schema Design**

### **Archive Table Structure**
Each archive table = identical structure to original + metadata:
```
All original fields (same schema)
archived_at (timestamp when moved)
archived_by (system/user who moved it)
original_table (source table name)
```

### **Deleted Table Structure**
Each deleted table = archive table + deletion metadata:
```
All archive fields
marked_for_deletion_at (timestamp)
legal_review_status (pending/approved/denied)
deletion_eligible_date (when actual deletion allowed)
```

## üîç **Query Strategy**

### **Active Queries (99% of traffic)**
- Query only active tables - fast performance
- Optimized indexes and caching

### **Historical Queries (1% of traffic)**
- Union queries across active + archive tables
- Acceptable slower performance for rare access

### **Compliance Queries (rare)**
- Union queries across active + archive + deleted tables
- Very slow performance acceptable for compliance needs

### **Query Helper Views**
Create views to simplify cross-table queries:
```
appointments_all (active + archive)
appointments_complete (active + archive + deleted)
medical_records_all (active + archive)
medical_records_complete (active + archive + deleted)
```

## ‚ö° **Performance Impact**

### **Active Table Benefits**
- **Smaller indexes** (faster queries)
- **Reduced table size** (better cache utilization)
- **Optimized for frequent operations**

### **Archive Table Trade-offs**
- **Slower historical queries** (acceptable for rare access)
- **More complex application logic** (union queries)
- **Additional storage management overhead**

## üîß **Implementation Considerations**

### **Current Table Modifications**
Add archive fields to current tables for future use:
```sql
-- Add to appointments, medical_records, audit_logs
is_archived BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
archived_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
archived_by VARCHAR(255)
```

### **Future Implementation Phases**
1. **Phase 1**: Add archive fields to current tables
2. **Phase 2**: Create archive table structures
3. **Phase 3**: Implement automated archive jobs
4. **Phase 4**: Create query helper views
5. **Phase 5**: Implement deletion table logic

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risks & Considerations**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Query Complexity**: Union queries across multiple tables
- **Storage Overhead**: Additional tables and indexes
- **Application Logic**: More complex data access patterns

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Gradual Implementation**: Implement one table at a time
- **Performance Testing**: Test archive queries before production
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for developers

## üìã **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Archive fields added to current tables
- [ ] Archive table structures created
- [ ] Automated archive jobs implemented
- [ ] Query helper views created
- [ ] Performance impact measured and acceptable

## üìù **Summary**

### **Why This Strategy Makes Sense**
1. **Healthcare Compliance**: Maintains data retention requirements
2. **Performance**: Keeps active tables fast and efficient
3. **Cost Optimization**: Balances storage costs with access needs
4. **Legal Support**: Supports legal hold and discovery requirements

### **When to Implement**
- **Not Now**: Focus on core functionality first
- **Phase 2**: After all services are working
- **Phase 3**: When performance becomes an issue
- **Phase 4**: When compliance requirements demand it

### **Key Benefits**
- **Active Performance**: Fast queries for daily operations
- **Compliance Ready**: Supports healthcare data retention
- **Cost Effective**: Optimizes storage for different data tiers
- **Future Proof**: Scalable as data grows
