# Healthcare AI Microservices - Implementation Backlog

> **High-Level Epic Planning** - We'll add detailed tasks after design docs are complete

## 📋 **Backlog Overview**

- **Current Status**: High-level epics only
- **Next Step**: Complete design docs for each service
- **After Design**: Add detailed tasks to each epic
- **Focus**: Foundation and core services first

---

## 📝 **Backlog Maintenance Rules**

### **Simple Rule**: Keep it clean and trackable

#### **1. Adding New Tasks**
- Add new tasks with full details (description, acceptance criteria, dependencies)
- Place in appropriate epic section
- Use proper formatting with all required fields

#### **2. Updating Completed Tasks**
- **Move details to Daily Work Log** - Keep full task history there
- **Keep basic info in Backlog** - Just task name, status, and brief summary
- **Move to "Completed Tasks" section** - At bottom of backlog
- **Order by completion date** - Most recent first

#### **3. Task Status**
- 📋 **TO DO**: Not started yet
- 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Finished (details moved to daily work)

## 🎯 **Project Philosophy: Keep it Simple for Learning**

### **What We're Building**
- **Learning Platform**: Focus on Spring Boot microservices mastery
- **Basic Functionality**: Working CRUD operations and simple integrations
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-designed, maintainable services
- **Practical Experience**: Deployable healthcare platform

### **What We're NOT Building** (Skip for now)

- ❌ **Redis Caching**: Basic in-memory caching is sufficient
- ❌ **Advanced Monitoring**: Simple health checks only
- ❌ **Service Mesh**: Not needed for learning project
- ❌ **Complex Orchestration**: Keep service communication simple

### **Focus Areas**
- ✅ **Core Services**: Patient, Provider, Appointment, AI, File Storage
- ✅ **Basic Authentication**: JWT validation with external provider
- ✅ **Simple Data Access**: Direct database access through shared layer
- ✅ **Basic Integration**: Services can call each other when needed
- ✅ **Simple Deployment**: Railway deployment with basic monitoring

## 📝 **Detailed Task Examples**

### **INFRA-001: Terraform Infrastructure Design**
**Component**: Infrastructure & Foundation
**Type**: Design Document
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Status**: 📋 To Do

**Description**: Design the Terraform infrastructure as code for the healthcare AI microservices platform

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Define infrastructure components (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Design database infrastructure (Neon PostgreSQL setup)
- Plan S3 bucket configuration for file storage
- Define service deployment patterns
- Document environment configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- Include monitoring and logging infrastructure

**Dependencies**: None
**Files to Update**: `docs/terraform-infrastructure-design.md`
**Why Needed**: Infrastructure design must be complete before any service implementation can begin

---

### **✅ COMPLETED: Service Boundaries Clarification**
**Component**: Architecture & Design
**Type**: Design Decision
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Description**: Clarified service responsibilities and boundaries

**What Was Accomplished**:
- **Patient Service**: Handles patient registration, profile management, allergies, health goals, risk factors
- **Provider Service**: Will handle medical records, diagnoses, treatments, visits, clinical notes
- **Appointment Service**: Will handle scheduling, booking, visit management, reminders
- **Clear separation**: Each service has distinct responsibilities and data ownership

**Files Updated**:
- `docs/patient-service-design.md` - Added service boundaries section
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` - Updated task status

**Next Steps**: Design Provider Service and Appointment Service with clear boundaries

---

### **✅ COMPLETED: Data Strategy Clarification**
**Component**: Documentation & Architecture
**Type**: Strategy Document
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Description**: Resolved all contradictions in data strategy across documentation

**What Was Accomplished**:
- Created clear data strategy document resolving all contradictions
- Clarified authentication approach (Option A - Stateless JWT Only)
- Defined clear separation between auth and business data
- Resolved conflicts between "no auth tables" and "user management tables"
- Established consistent database strategy across all documents

**Files Created/Updated**:
- `docs/data-strategy.md` - New comprehensive data strategy document
- `docs/authentication-design.md` - Updated to reflect stateless approach

**Next Steps**: Update remaining documents to align with clarified strategy

## 📊 **Current Focus**

### **Next Priority Tasks** (API-First Approach!)
1. **INFRA-001: Terraform Infrastructure Design** (highest priority - foundational)
2. **INFRA-002: Simple Deployment Design** (basic deployment patterns)
3. **🚧 Service API Design Template** (in progress - best practices and standards)
4. **Then**: Design each service API (Patient → Provider → Appointment → AI)
5. **Finally**: Refine database design based on actual API requirements

### **Why This Order Makes Sense**
- **Infrastructure First**: Need to know where and how to deploy services
- **API Design Second**: Define what each service does and what data it needs
- **Database Last**: Schema design should be based on actual API requirements, not assumptions
- **Data-Driven Design**: Database emerges from service API design, ensuring perfect alignment

### **After Design Docs Complete**:
- Add detailed tasks to each epic
- Break down into sprints
- Add effort estimates
- Add dependencies between tasks

---

## ✅ **Completed Tasks**

*Tasks will appear here as they are completed, with basic info only. Full details are in the Daily Work Log.*

---

## 📝 **Notes**

- **Don't over-plan now** - Focus on design docs first
- **Keep it simple** - Just the main epics and goals
- **Add details later** - After we understand what we're building
- **Iterative approach** - Design → Plan → Build → Refine

---

*This backlog will grow as we complete design docs and understand the detailed requirements for each service.*
