# Healthcare AI Microservices - Implementation Backlog

> **High-Level Epic Planning** - We'll add detailed tasks after design docs are complete

## 📋 **Backlog Overview**

- **Current Status**: High-level epics only
- **Next Step**: Complete design docs for each service

## 📝 **Backlog Maintenance Rules**

### **Simple Rule**: Keep it clean and trackable

#### **1. Adding New Tasks**
- Add new tasks with full details (description, acceptance criteria, dependencies)
- Place in appropriate epic section
- Use proper formatting with all required fields

#### **2. Updating Completed Tasks**
- **Move details to Daily Work Log** - Keep full task history there
- **Keep basic info in Backlog** - Just task name, status, and brief summary
- **Move to "Completed Tasks" section** - At bottom of backlog
- **Order by completion date** - Most recent first

#### **3. Task Status**
- 📋 **TO DO**: Not started yet

## 📋 **CURRENT TASKS: Design Documentation**

### **Immediate Priority**: Complete All Design Documents
*These design docs must be completed before we can add detailed implementation tasks to each epic.*

**Note**: Each service now has its own epic (EPIC 3-7) since they will contain many detailed tasks. This allows for better organization and tracking of progress within each service domain.

#### **🏗️ Infrastructure Design Docs**
- [ ] **INFRA-001: Terraform Infrastructure Design** - Infrastructure as Code, deployment patterns, environment setup
- [ ] **INFRA-002: Shared Module Design** - Common utilities, data access patterns, exception handling
- [ ] **INFRA-003: Database Schema Design** - All tables, relationships, and data models
- [ ] **INFRA-004: Infrastructure Design** - Deployment, monitoring, and operational patterns

#### **🔐 Authentication & Gateway Design Docs**

## ✅ **Completed Tasks**

*Tasks will appear here as they are completed, with basic info only. Full details are in the Daily Work Log.*

---

## 📝 **Notes**

- **Don't over-plan now** - Focus on design docs first
- **Keep it simple** - Just the main epics and goals
- **Add details later** - After we understand what we're building
- **Iterative approach** - Design → Plan → Build → Refine

---

*This backlog will grow as we complete design docs and understand the detailed requirements for each service.*
