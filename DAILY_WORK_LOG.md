## üìù **Quick Notes**

**What I worked on**: Database design consistency fixes and service design alignment. Focused on ensuring all design documents reference the correct 6-table database structure and fixing table naming inconsistencies.

**Key decisions made**:
- **Table Naming Standardization**: All services now reference `patient_profiles` and `provider_profiles` consistently
- **Database Structure Alignment**: All service designs now match the 6-table structure from database-design.md
- **Appointment Service Fix**: Corrected table structure to use proper UUID primary key and composite indexes
- **Documentation Consistency**: Ensured all design documents reference the same table names and relationships
- **Architecture Diagram Updates**: Fixed all diagrams to show correct table relationships and data flow
- **Data Strategy Cleanup**: Removed medical_record_extensions references to maintain strict 6-table count

**Any issues**: Successfully resolved all table naming inconsistencies and ensured perfect alignment across all design documents.

**Tomorrow's focus**: Begin Phase 1 implementation - Gateway + Auth + Patient Service foundation
