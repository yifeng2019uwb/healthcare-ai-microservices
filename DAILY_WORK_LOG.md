## üìù **Quick Notes**

**What I worked on**: H2 to PostgreSQL migration and healthcare validation pattern updates. Focused on ensuring consistent enum handling across all environments and making validation patterns realistic for real-world healthcare systems.

**Key decisions made**:
- **Database Consistency**: Replaced H2 with PostgreSQL for all environments to avoid enum handling differences
- **Configuration Management**: Created separate configs for dev, test, and production with proper PostgreSQL settings
- **Test Database Setup**: Built comprehensive test schema with all PostgreSQL enums and sample data
- **Validation Realism**: Updated validation patterns to match actual healthcare industry standards
- **Patient Number Flexibility**: Support various formats (6-12 digits, prefixes, dashes, facility codes)
- **Insurance Policy Flexibility**: Support Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance formats
- **Medical Record Flexibility**: Support various medical record system formats
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive database setup guide for team use

**Any issues**: Successfully resolved H2 vs PostgreSQL consistency issues. All 176 tests passing with PostgreSQL configuration.

**Tomorrow's focus**: Implement repository layer, then move to DTOs and APIs for Patient and Provider services
