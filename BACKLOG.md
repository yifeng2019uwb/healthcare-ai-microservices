# Healthcare AI Microservices - Implementation Backlog

> **High-Level Epic Planning** - We'll add detailed tasks after design docs are complete

## 📋 **Backlog Overview**

- **Current Status**: High-level epics only
- **Next Step**: Complete design docs for each service
- **After Design**: Add detailed tasks to each epic
- **Focus**: Foundation and core services first

---

## 📝 **Backlog Maintenance Rules**

### **Simple Rule**: Keep it clean and trackable

#### **1. Adding New Tasks**
- Add new tasks with full details (description, acceptance criteria, dependencies)
- Place in appropriate epic section
- Use proper formatting with all required fields

#### **2. Updating Completed Tasks**
- **Move details to Daily Work Log** - Keep full task history there
- **Keep basic info in Backlog** - Just task name, status, and brief summary
- **Move to "Completed Tasks" section** - At bottom of backlog
- **Order by completion date** - Most recent first

#### **3. Task Status**
- 📋 **TO DO**: Not started yet
- 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Finished (details moved to daily work)

## 📊 **Current Focus**

### **Next Priority Tasks** (Ready for Implementation!)
1. ✅ **INFRA-001: Terraform Infrastructure Design** (COMPLETED - foundational)
2. ✅ **INFRA-002: Simple Deployment Design** (COMPLETED - basic deployment patterns)
3. ✅ **Service API Design Template** (COMPLETED - best practices and standards)
4. ✅ **Service API Designs** (COMPLETED - Patient → Provider → Appointment → AI)
5. ✅ **Database Design** (COMPLETED - based on API requirements)
6. 🚀 **BEGIN PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION** - Gateway + Auth + Patient Service

### **Why This Order Makes Sense**
- **Infrastructure First**: Need to know where and how to deploy services
- **API Design Second**: Define what each service does and what data it needs
- **Database Last**: Schema design should be based on actual API requirements, not assumptions
- **Data-Driven Design**: Database emerges from service API design, ensuring perfect alignment

### **After Design Docs Complete**:
- Add detailed tasks to each epic
- Break down into sprints
- Add effort estimates
- Add dependencies between tasks

## 📝 **Notes**

- **Don't over-plan now** - Focus on design docs first
- **Keep it simple** - Just the main epics and goals
- **Add details later** - After we understand what we're building
- **Iterative approach** - Design → Plan → Build → Refine

---

*This backlog will grow as we complete design docs and understand the detailed requirements for each service.*
