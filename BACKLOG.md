# Healthcare AI Microservices - Implementation Backlog

> **High-Level Epic Planning** - We'll add detailed tasks after design docs are complete

## 📋 **Backlog Overview**

- **Current Status**: High-level epics only
- **Next Step**: Complete design docs for each service
- **After Design**: Add detailed tasks to each epic
- **Focus**: Foundation and core services first

---

## 📝 **Backlog Maintenance Rules**

### **Simple Rule**: Keep it clean and trackable

#### **1. Adding New Tasks**
- Add new tasks with full details (description, acceptance criteria, dependencies)
- Place in appropriate epic section
- Use proper formatting with all required fields

#### **2. Updating Completed Tasks**
- **Move details to Daily Work Log** - Keep full task history there
- **Keep basic info in Backlog** - Just task name, status, and brief summary
- **Move to "Completed Tasks" section** - At bottom of backlog
- **Order by completion date** - Most recent first

#### **3. Task Status**
- 📋 **TO DO**: Not started yet
- 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Finished (details moved to daily work)

## 📊 **Current Focus**

### **Next Priority Tasks** (Ready for Implementation!)
1. ✅ **Design Documents** (COMPLETED - all service designs complete)
2. ✅ **Database Design** (COMPLETED - based on API requirements)
3. ✅ **Infrastructure Design** (COMPLETED - Terraform setup complete)
