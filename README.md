# Healthcare AI Microservices Platform

> **Learning-Focused Healthcare AI Platform** - Master Spring Boot, AI Integration, and Microservices Architecture

## üéØ **What This Project Is**

A comprehensive healthcare AI microservices platform designed for learning Spring Boot, AI integration, and microservices patterns. Built with clean architecture principles and progressive complexity.

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **High-Level Overview**
This project implements a **hybrid Java + Python microservices architecture** for healthcare AI applications. The system uses **Neon PostgreSQL as the single primary database** for all business data and authentication, with **AWS S3 for file storage**.

### **Backend Architecture**
- **API Gateway (Port 8080)**: Single external entry point, routes to business services
- **Auth Service (Port 8001)**: JWT validation only, no business logic
- **Business Services (Ports 8002-8006)**: Handle business logic, can call each other internally when needed
- **Data Layer**: Primary data access method for all services

### **Port Management Strategy**
- **External Access**: Only port 8080 (API Gateway) exposed to the internet
- **Internal Services**: All business services run internally on ports 8001-8006
- **Single Entry Point**: All external traffic goes through the Gateway for routing and security

### **Technology Distribution**
- **Java Services (6)**: Gateway, Auth, Patient, Provider, Appointment, File Storage
- **Python Service (1)**: AI Service for ML/AI capabilities
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (single instance, multiple schemas)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for medical documents and images
- **Frontend**: React applications for different user roles

## üöÄ **Key Features**

### **üîê Authentication & Security**
- **Internal Auth Service**: Spring Boot JWT authentication
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token management
- **Role-based Access Control**: Patient, Provider, Admin roles
- **Basic Compliance**: Simple audit trails and data protection

### **üíæ Data Management**
- **Shared Data Layer**: Common database access patterns for all services
- **Single Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with service-specific schemas
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for cross-domain file management
- **Service Independence**: No inter-service calls, direct data access

### **ü§ñ AI Integration**
- **Centralized AI Service**: All AI capabilities in one service
- **AI Assistant**: Chatbot and patient support
- **Smart Scheduling**: AI-powered appointment optimization
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Treatment recommendations

### **üè• Healthcare Features**
- **Patient Management**: Complete patient profiles and medical history
